### SISL Environments

    n_walkers: number of bipedal walker agents in environment
    position_noise: noise applied to agent positional sensor observations
    angle_noise: noise applied to agent rotational sensor observations
    local_ratio: Proportion of reward allocated locally vs distributed among all agents
    forward_reward: reward applied for an agent standing, scaled by agentâ€™s x coordinate
    fall_reward: reward applied when an agent falls down
    terminate_reward: reward applied to a walker for failing the environment
    terminate_on_fall: toggles whether agent is done if it falls down
    remove_on_fall: Remove walker when it falls (only does anything when terminate_on_fall is False)
    max_cycles: after max_cycles steps all agents will return done
